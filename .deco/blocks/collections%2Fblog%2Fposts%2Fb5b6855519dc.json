Also known as a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, it allows users to manipulate content as it will appear to the end-user, providing an intuitive and accessible way to manage web content.</p><p></p><h1>How does a visual editor work in CMS and headless CMS?</h1><p></p><p>Visual editors are integral to both traditional CMS and headless CMS environments, offering an accessible way for non-technical users to manage and format content. Hereâ€™s how visual editors function within these contexts:</p><p></p><p><strong>1. WYSIWYG Interface:</strong></p><p>In traditional CMS platforms such as WordPress and Joomla, visual editors are built into the core system, enabling users to format text, insert images, create links, and more, all within a user-friendly interface. For example, the WordPress Classic Editor and Gutenberg Block Editor provide extensive formatting tools directly within the content creation area.</p><p></p><p>In headless CMS platforms often integrate with external visual editors or offer built-in solutions that connect to the backend via APIs. This allows content creators to preview and edit content without dealing with the underlying code. For example, platforms like Strapi and Contentful offer visual editing capabilities that streamline content management.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Drag-and-drop functionality:</strong></p><p>Many visual editors include drag-and-drop features, allowing users to easily add and rearrange content elements like text blocks, images, videos, and interactive components. This functionality enhances the flexibility and ease of use, making content creation more efficient and intuitive.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Real-time preview:</strong></p><p>Visual editors provide real-time previews of the content as it will appear on the live site. This feature helps users to see how their changes will look instantly, reducing the guesswork and ensuring a better final product. This is especially useful in headless CMS setups, where content might be delivered to multiple frontends.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Customization and extensibility:</strong></p><p>Visual editors can be customized and extended with plugins or custom components to meet specific needs. For example, adding custom blocks or widgets tailored to the site's requirements can enhance the editor's functionality and provide a more tailored content management experience.</p><p></p><h1>Examples of visual editors in action:</h1><p></p><p><strong>Traditional CMS:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>WordPress Gutenberg:</strong> A block-based editor that allows users to create complex layouts using various blocks such as text, images, galleries, and embedded content. Gutenberg's drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to build and arrange content visually.</p></li><li><p><strong>Joomla JCE:</strong> A popular visual editor for Joomla that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating and formatting content, including image handling, media embedding, and custom styling options.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Headless CMS:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Contentful:</strong> Offers a visual editing interface that allows users to manage content types and entries with a clear preview of how the content will be presented. Contentful's editor supports rich text, media, and custom components, making it a versatile choice for headless CMS.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strapi:</strong> Integrates with various visual editors to provide a user-friendly interface for content management. Users can add and format content with ease, preview changes in real-time, and manage the content delivery across multiple platforms.</p></li></ul><p></p><h1>What are the benefits of using a visual editor?</h1><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Simplifies content creation and editing, making it accessible for non-technical users.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Speeds up the content management process by providing intuitive tools and real-time previews.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Allows for easy customization and integration of various content elements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced collaboration:</strong> Enables content creators, marketers, and developers to work together more effectively by providing a clear, visual representation of the content.</p></li><li><p></p></li></ul><p>By providing a user-friendly, WYSIWYG interface, deco ensures that both technical and non-technical users can manage and format content effortlessly. Whether you're working with a traditional CMS or a headless CMS setup, deco's visual editor streamlines content creation and ensures a seamless user experience.</p><p></p><p>A visual editor is a crucial tool in CMS and headless CMS environments, providing an intuitive and efficient way to create and manage content without needing technical expertise.

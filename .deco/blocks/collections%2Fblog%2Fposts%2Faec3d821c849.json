    "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">In a project management scenario, a backlog is a repository for everything that needs to be done (tasks, features, and requirements) and is prioritized by importance or urgency. In ecommerce and digital platforms, a well-maintained backlog is crucial for keeping development teams focused, organized, and aligned with business goals.</span></p><p><br></p><h1><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">What is </span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Backlog</span><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">?</span></strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">&nbsp;</span></h1><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">A backlog is more than just a to-do list. It’s a strategic tool in project management that guides the development process. It includes user stories, bug fixes, tasks for the design or content team, technical debts, and new features. By prioritizing these items, teams can ensure they are working on the most urgent tasks, improving resources and time.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">One of the key benefits of using a backlog is transparency. It offers a clear view of what the team is working on, what’s coming next, the deadlines, and what has been completed. This transparency promotes better communication among teams, stakeholders, and clients.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">In ecommerce, backlogs play a crucial role in maintaining a competitive advantage. For example, if a business area finds a trend or a user need, it can quickly add related tasks to the backlog and by addressing them systematically, they are enhancing the overall user experience.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">Digital platforms, such as social media networks or CMS, also rely on backlogs. This might include developing a new feature, improving an existing one, or fixing a bug. These platforms continuously evolve, requiring regular updates and improvements. A well-organized backlog helps teams manage these updates, ensuring that features are rolled out efficiently.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h2><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">When can </span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Backlog </span><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">be used?</span></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">To illustrate when a company can use a backlog, for example, when a platform decides to introduce a new algorithm for content recommendations or a new messaging feature, the backlog would include tasks such as designing the user interface, reviewing the content, developing the backend infrastructure, and conducting user testing.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Another practical example of backlog use is the rollout of a new payment gateway in an ecommerce. The development team would add tasks related to integration, testing, and deployment to the backlog. By prioritizing these tasks, the team ensures that the integration is completed providing users with a seamless payment experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h2><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">How can </span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Backlog </span><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">be used?</span></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Using backlog management tools can enhance the efficiency of keeping a backlog. Tools such as Jira, Trello, and Asana provide features to create, prioritize, and track backlog items. These tools offer a visual representation of the backlog, helping teams visualize their workflow, identify stoppages, and streamline processes, making it easier to manage.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Maintaining an effective backlog requires reviewing and updating the items, reprioritizing tasks, and ensuring that they reflect the current business goals. In ecommerce, for instance, an impulsive change in market trends might need the addition of new features or the re-prioritization of existing ones.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">However, with a well-organized backlog, everyone can see the progress and understand the cause behind task prioritization (or reprioritization), leading to increased trust and collaboration. It helps teams stay organized, aligned with business goals, and responsive to changes.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">At deco, for example, you can experience Figma-like collaboration to manage revisions and gain full control over publications. It will definitely help your team with their backlog.

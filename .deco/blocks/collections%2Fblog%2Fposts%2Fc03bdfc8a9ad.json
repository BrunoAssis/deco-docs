    "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">AI is a fascinating and powerful technology that simulates human intelligence to perform tasks and solve problems. Simply put, AI involves creating algorithms and systems capable of learning, reasoning, and self-correcting. This technology is transforming the digital landscape and is already a part of our daily lives and jobs.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">What is </span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Artificial Intelligence</span><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">?</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">AI isn’t just about robots taking over the world (although that’s a fun thought). It’s about creating systems that process information, recognize patterns, and make decisions. AI incorporates machine learning, where algorithms improve through experience, and deep learning, a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to analyze data. Think of AI as the brain behind technologies like voice assistants, recommendation engines, and also autonomous vehicles.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">When can </span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Artificial Intelligence</span><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\"> be used?</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">AI can be used whenever there’s a need to analyze large amounts of data or text and make decisions quickly. It's perfect for repetitive tasks and complex problem-solving. In ecommerce, for example, AI’s applications range from personalizing shopping experiences to improving supply chains. Digital platforms use AI for content recommendations, user engagement analysis, and even automating customer service.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">How to use </span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt\">Artificial Intelligence </span><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">in ecommerce and digital platforms?</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">Have you ever wondered how online stores seem to know what you want? That’s AI at work, personalizing shopping experiences by analyzing user behavior and predicting preferences besides using algorithms to recommend products based on your browsing history. It’s like having a personal shopper who knows you better than you know yourself.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">One of the fantastic AI applications in ecommerce is chatbots. They provide automatic answers to customer questions, manage multiple conversations simultaneously, and improve over time through machine learning. This means no more waiting on hold or navigating endless phone menus.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">These AI assistants can help with everything from tracking orders to answering product questions, making the shopping experience smoother and more enjoyable. According to research by Zendesk, 70% of leaders of Customer Experience believe that chatbots are turning into skilled architectures of personalized journeys, uniting speed and personalization in experiences.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">AI also plays a crucial role in the industry for inventory and supply chain management. AI can predict demand trends, optimize stock levels, and reduce waste. By analyzing sales data and external factors like seasonality, AI ensures that warehouses are stocked with the right products at the right time. This not only improves efficiency but also reduces costs and minimizes environmental impact.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">Digital platforms, whether social media networks, streaming services, or news websites, are heavily reliant on AI. Algorithms curate content to keep users engaged, delivering personalized experiences that feel almost tailor-made. This isn’t just about showing you content you like, but it’s about predicting what you’ll find interesting next. It’s a mix of data science, psychology, and a sprinkle of magic.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">The algorithms that curate content also analyze user engagement. It tracks how users interact with content, what they like, share, and comment on, and uses this data to refine algorithms. This means platforms can continuously improve, providing users with content that’s increasingly relevant and engaging.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">For example, Netflix's recommendation engine analyzes viewing habits to suggest movies that you’re likely to enjoy. Similarly, Spotify uses AI to create playlists based on your listening history. These recommendations aren’t random, they’re carefully calculated to keep you engaged, enhance your user experience, and encourage you to return for more.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">AI is a game-changer for ecommerce and digital platforms, offering a blend of personalization, efficiency, and engagement. It’s a tool that, when used effectively, can transform how businesses operate and how users interact with technology.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">At deco, for example, we have </span><u><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">deco.pilot</span></u><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); font-size: 12pt\">, an AI assistant for code and content generation to help you get your site done faster.

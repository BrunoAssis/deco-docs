description: Client-side Interactivity.
since: 1.1.0

One of the reasons deco is fast is our edge first approach to creating websites. This means that all code you write runs on our servers instead of running on slow, inconsitent user devices (browser). However, sometimes we need to provide extra interactivity to our websites, like adding `onClick`, `useState` or `useEffect` event handlers. 
In this guide you will learn how to create components that run on the browser. Make sure to read our performance tips before creating any JavaScript on the browser to avoid common pitfails with client-side JavaScript

# Making components interactive
Suppose you have the following component. A counter that allows the user to add/subtract to the displayed value. 
// TODO: add component's image

This component can be implemented with the following code:
```tsx
import { useState } from 'preact/hooks'

export default function Counter () {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count-1)}>
        -
      </button>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count+1)}>
        +
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Creating a file called `Counter.tsx` and placing it into the `components` folder gives us the following result on the screen:
// TODO: add component's image

However, when we try clicking on the button, nothing happens. This is because deco does not ship any JavaScript to the browser, thus making hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` not work. To opt into shipping JavaScript to the browser, you must move the `Counter.tsx` file into a special folder called `islands` in the project's root. Moving the component's file into the `islands` folder, we have the component with a working interaction
// TODO: add component's image gif

This component is now called an `island`!

Althought adding islands to your project solves seems tempting, keep in mind that islands slow down websites and harm [TBT metric](https://web.dev/tbt/), so before moving any component to the `island` folder, make sure that your final interactivity:

- Isn't achieved through page navigation with links or form submissions...
- Isn't an interaction built purely with CSS...
- Requires manipulation of elements or the current page's state
(e.g., using onClick, onChange, useEffect, another hook, or an event listener)


## Islands usage limitations

An island can receive properties like any other component, as long as these properties are serializable. This means you can receive the following values:

- Primitive types `string`, `boolean`, `bigint`, and `null`
- Most numbers (`Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` are converted to `null`)
- Simple objects with `string` keys and serializable values
- Arrays of serializable values
- `Uint8Array`
- JSX Elements (ONLY as props.children)
- Preact Signals (if the signal value is serializable)

Complex objects such as Date, functions, and custom classes are not accepted in islands props.

## Signals

In Preact, it's common to use signals for managing component state and control user interaction.

A signal:

- is created with an initial value (`const count = useSignal(0);`)
- is used by a component (`Counter is at {count}.{" "}`)
- triggers a re-render of components that use it when the signal is updated (`count.value += 1`)

To define side-effects over signal changes, use the `effect`, `batch`, `computed`, or `useComputed` operations. Refer to the [signals documentation](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/) for more details.

# Creating your first island

## Adding a new component (`RandomDogFact.tsx`)

1. Create a file named `RandomDogFact.tsx` in the `islands` folder

2. Open the `islands/RandomDogFact.tsx` file and add the following content:

```tsx
import { signal } from "@preact/signals";

export interface DogFact {
    fact: string;
  }
  
  export interface Props {
    title: string;
  }
  
  const getNewDogFact = async () => {
    const { facts: dogFacts } = (await fetch(
      `https://dogapi.dog/api/facts?number=1`,
    ).then((r) => r.json())) as { facts: string[] };
    if (dogFacts[0]) {
        dogFact.value = dogFacts[0];
    }
  }
  
  const dogFact = signal<string>("üêï");

  export default function RandomDogFact({ title }: Props) {
    return (
      <div onClick={getNewDogFact} class="p-4 cursor-pointer">
        <h1 class="font-bold">{title}</h1>
        <span>{dogFact}</span>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

3. Use the `<RandomDogFact>` element in a section. For example:

```tsx
import RandomDogFact from "deco-sites/fashion/islands/RandomDogFact.tsx";

// ...

function ProductGallery({ products, layout }: Props) {
  return (
    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 items-center sm:grid-cols-4 sm:gap-10">
      <RandomDogFact title="Dog Fact" />
      {products?.map((product, index) => (
        <ProductCard product={product} preload={index === 0} layout={layout} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Being an island, the `RandomDogFact` element is rendered once on the server, but its HTML and JS (including its dependencies) are sent to the browser to have its JS enabled and executed again. If this island were not placed in the islands directory, it would not be clickable.

## Considerations and tips

Making a component an island will at least double its size in bytes. The server renders the HTML for this element and sends it to the browser, but it also sends essentially the same HTML plus the JS to be injected on the client side. Therefore, try to create only the necessary islands, as they make the rendering process more resource-intensive.

Also, refer to:

- TODO RECIPES

# Troubleshooting

## Island has no interaction

The file must be in the `islands` directory. The file cannot be in any subdirectory within `islands`. Check if there are any errors in the `console` that prevented the hydration process.

## Island does not run and/or displays errors in the deno console.

All island initialization JavaScript code runs first on the server and then on the client. It's common to include code that only makes sense on the server (e.g., using `localStorage`, manipulating the DOM, making a request, etc.). You can use `IS_BROWSER` to determine that a code should only be executed on the client.

```tsx
import { useSignal } from "@preact/signals";
import { IS_BROWSER } from "$fresh/runtime.ts";

export default function MyIsland() {
  let initalValue = 0;
  if (IS_BROWSER) {
    initalValue = localStorage.getItem("count");
  }
  const count = useSignal(initalValue);

  return (
    <div>
      Counter is at {count}.{" "}
      <button onClick={() => (count.value += 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
